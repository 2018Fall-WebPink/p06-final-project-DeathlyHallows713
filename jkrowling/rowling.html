        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <img src="jkrowling.jpg" title="Joanne Rowling reading the first Harry Potter book in the series" alt="Joanne Rowling reading Harry Potter out loud to fans" id="jkrowling"/>
        <p>Joanne Rowling, more commonly known as J. K. Rowling, is the famous author of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series. Her penname is a combination of her first initial, her grandmother's first inital (her name was Kathy), and her last name. She intended to hide her identify a bit because her books were geared towards young boys around the age of ten, and she thought they wouldn't read her writing if they knew she was a female author.</p>
        
        <p>She has been through some rough times in her life, growing up in a small suburban town in England. Her mother died of multiple sclerosis when she was still fairly young, and she had a hard time getting her first book, <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i> published because people thought it was too long. Joanne had been married more than once and had a daughter named Jessica. Jessica was only a baby when her mom finally got her book published by a small business called Bloomsbury. <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jk-rowling/" target="_blank">More on how she got her first book published</a></p>
        
        <p>Joanne's Wizarding World includes 12 books, has been translated into over 80 languages, and more than ten award-winning movies have even been made after them, including the <i>Fantastic Beats</i> series. She's even written three murder mystery books under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith to avoid expectations before her cover was blown and her identity was revealed.<a href="https://robert-galbraith.com/writing/" target="_blank">More about Robert Galbraith</a></p>
